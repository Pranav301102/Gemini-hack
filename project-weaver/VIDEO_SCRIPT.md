# Project Weaver - Demo Video Script
**Target Length:** 3-4 minutes
**Tone:** Professional, energetic, problem-solution focused

---

## OPENING (0:00-0:20)

### Hook
> "What if AI agents could remember everything, work as a real team, and never waste time re-reading your codebase?"

**[Show animation or title slide: "Project Weaver - 5 AI Agents. One Shared Brain."]**

### Problem Statement
> "Today's AI coding assistants have amnesia. Every conversation starts from scratch. Multiple agents duplicate work. And your team? They can't benefit from each other's AI interactions."

**[Quick cuts showing: frustration, repeated questions, wasted time]**

## ACT 1: THE SOLUTION (0:20-0:50)

### Introduce Project Weaver
> "Meet Project Weaver - an AI software agency built on Google Gemini 2.0. Five specialized agents that actually work together."

**[Show dashboard overview with all 5 agents visible]**

### The Innovation
> "Here's what makes it different: Every agent reads from and writes to a shared context board. One scans your codebase? Everyone knows. One proposes architecture? It's in the shared memory. No re-reading. No duplicate work."

**[Show Context Board with entries from different agents flowing in]**

---

## ACT 2: LIVE DEMO - CORE FEATURES (0:50-2:30)

### Feature 1: Code Intelligence (0:50-1:10)
> "Let's start with the Scanner agent. It uses Tree-sitter to deeply parse your entire codebase..."

**[Show Code Intelligence view]**
- Pan through class hierarchy
- Show module relationships
- Highlight function annotations

> "...and enriches every symbol with Gemini's understanding. Not just 'what' the code does - but 'why' it exists."

### Feature 2: Planning Agent (1:10-1:35)
> "Now the Architect takes over. It reads the scanned index from shared memory..."

**[Show Plan Navigator]**
- Display change groups
- Show file impact analysis
- Reveal architecture diagrams

> "...and generates a detailed implementation plan. Notice it's not starting from zero - it's building on what the Scanner learned."

### Feature 3: Team Collaboration (1:35-2:00)
> "Here's where it gets powerful for teams. Everything lives in a `.weaver/` directory that commits to git."

**[Show Team View]**
- Display active team members
- Show code annotations
- Highlight verification status

> "When your teammate pulls the repo, they get the entire AI context. The scanned index. The architectural decisions. The verified annotations. It's like giving them your AI's brain."

### Feature 4: Human Verification (2:00-2:20)
> "But AI makes mistakes. That's why we built human verification. Agents write code annotations..."

**[Show annotation with pending status]**

> "...and humans verify them. Trust builds over time. The more annotations you verify, the smarter the system becomes."

**[Show verified annotation with confidence score]**

### Feature 5: Hub Sync (2:20-2:30)
> "And for real-time collaboration? We built Weaver Hub. Push your context to a shared server. Your team pulls it instantly. No git commit needed."

**[Show Hub sync interface with push/pull buttons]**

## ACT 3: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (2:30-3:00)

### The Stack
> "Under the hood: 55 MCP tools across 19 modules. Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for reasoning. Next.js for the dashboard. Tree-sitter for AST parsing. All connected through the Model Context Protocol."

**[Show quick montage of:]**
- Code editor with MCP tools
- Dashboard updating in real-time via SSE
- Terminal showing agent collaboration

### The Architecture
> "The architecture is elegant: Agents are stateless. Memory is persistent. Everything is git-native. Your AI's knowledge survives across sessions, machines, and team members."

**[Show architecture diagram if available]**

---

## ACT 4: THE IMPACT (3:00-3:30)

### Use Cases
> "Imagine onboarding a new developer. They clone the repo and instantly get months of AI-generated insights. Or refactoring legacy code - the AI remembers every past decision."

**[Show quick cuts of realistic use cases]**

### The Vision
> "We're not just building better AI assistants. We're building AI teams that remember, collaborate, and compound their knowledge over time."

**[Show team working together with AI in the background]**

---

## CLOSING (3:30-3:50)

### Call to Action
> "Project Weaver. Built for the Gemini 3 Hackathon. Open source. Ready to deploy."

**[Show GitHub repo and deployment instructions]**

### Final Hook
> "Because the best AI doesn't forget. It learns."

**[End screen with:]**
- Project name and tagline
- GitHub link
- "Built with Google Gemini 2.0"
- Social links if applicable

## RECORDING TIPS

### Visual Guidelines
1. **Keep the dashboard open** - Show the UI throughout, not just slides
2. **Use smooth transitions** - Fade between tabs/views
3. **Highlight cursor movement** - Make it easy to follow along
4. **Show real data** - Use the demo mode we just built
5. **Add subtle animations** - When showing features appearing

### Audio Guidelines
1. **Speak clearly and confidently** - You're explaining something revolutionary
2. **Vary your pace** - Slow down for key points, speed up for transitions
3. **Use music** - Upbeat, tech-focused background track (low volume)
4. **Add sound effects** - Subtle whooshes for transitions

### Technical Setup
1. **Resolution:** 1920x1080 minimum
2. **Frame rate:** 30fps or 60fps
3. **Screen recording tool:** OBS Studio, QuickTime, or Loom
4. **Audio:** External mic recommended (Blue Yeti, Rode, etc.)
5. **Lighting:** Good lighting if showing yourself

## ALTERNATIVE: QUICK 90-SECOND VERSION

If you need a shorter version:

1. **Problem** (15s): AI has amnesia, teams can't collaborate
2. **Solution** (15s): Project Weaver - 5 agents, shared memory, git-native
3. **Demo** (45s): Show Context Board → Plan → Team → Verification
4. **Impact** (15s): Real-time collaboration, persistent knowledge

## BONUS: B-ROLL IDEAS

If you have extra time, capture these for cutting between main shots:
- Terminal showing agent activity
- Code being written/modified
- Git commits happening
- Multiple team members collaborating
- Annotations being verified
- Real-time SSE updates flowing in
- Architecture diagrams being generated
