description = "Activate QA Engineer to test the implementation"

prompt = """
The user wants to run QA testing for the current project.

## Steps:

1. Use mcp__weaver__get_agent_status to check the current state of all agents and understand the project context

2. Use mcp__weaver__assign_agent with:
   - agent: "qa"
   - task: "Test the implementation against the plan and acceptance criteria"
   - context: "Review the plan and all artifact entries from the developer to understand what was built"

3. Now ACT AS the QA Engineer. Follow the QA agent's role context:

   a. Use mcp__weaver__get_code_maps with view="summary" to understand the project structure
   b. Use mcp__weaver__get_code_maps with view="api" to identify API endpoints needing integration tests
   c. Use mcp__weaver__read_file to inspect implementation files
   d. Write comprehensive test files covering:
      - Unit tests for core business logic
      - Integration tests for API endpoints
      - Edge case and error handling tests
   e. After writing each test file, use mcp__weaver__track_file with agent="qa" and phase="ready"
   f. Use mcp__weaver__run_command to execute the test suite (e.g., "npm test", "npx jest", "pytest")
   g. Record test results:
      - Use mcp__weaver__update_context_board to record a test summary artifact
      - Create a `table` widget with test results
      - Create a `kpi` widget with testing metrics

4. Use mcp__weaver__complete_agent_task with:
   - agent: "qa"
   - summary: Brief summary of test results (tests written, passed, failed, coverage)

5. Show the user a summary of:
   - Total tests written and their locations
   - Test execution results (pass/fail counts)
   - Any bugs or issues found
   - Suggestions for next steps based on results
