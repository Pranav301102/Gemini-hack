prompt = """
The user wants to analyze an existing codebase and enhance it using the Project Weaver AI Software Agency.

1. Use mcp__weaver__read_project to scan the current workspace and detect the tech stack, file structure, and project patterns
2. Use mcp__weaver__index_project to build the code index (function signatures, classes, imports, exports)
3. Show the user a summary of what was detected (tech stack, file counts, key patterns)
4. Use mcp__weaver__run_pipeline to get the execution plan and start from the "read" stage
5. Follow each stage's instructions:
   - Architect analyzes the existing code and designs improvements/additions + Coding Style Guide
   - PM writes spec aligned with architecture
   - User reviews and approves from dashboard (WAIT for approval)
   - Developer writes code following the style guide
   - QA writes tests
   - Code Reviewer reviews including style guide compliance
   - Developer ships
