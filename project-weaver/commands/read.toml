prompt = """
The user wants to analyze an existing codebase using Project Weaver.

1. Use mcp__weaver__read_project to scan the current workspace and detect the tech stack, file structure, and project patterns
2. Use mcp__weaver__index_project to build the code index (function signatures, classes, imports, exports)
3. Use mcp__weaver__build_dependency_graph to compute file relationships
4. Use mcp__weaver__build_code_maps to generate class diagrams, module maps, call graphs, and API maps
5. Show the user a summary:
   - Tech stack and file counts
   - Classes and interfaces found
   - Module structure detected
   - API endpoints found (if any)
   - Key architectural patterns
6. Tell the user: "Project indexed with code maps. Run /build to create a plan."
