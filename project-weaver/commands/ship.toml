The user wants to ship the project and create a final summary.

## Steps:

1. Use mcp__weaver__get_agent_status to check the current state of all agents and gather project context

2. Use mcp__weaver__assign_agent with:
   - agent: "developer"
   - task: "Create final shipping summary and deployment instructions"

3. Now ACT AS the Developer to create the ship summary:

   a. **Gather Project State:**
      - Use mcp__weaver__get_code_maps with view="summary" to get project overview
      - Use mcp__weaver__get_code_maps with view="api" to list all API endpoints
      - Read the plan to get the list of what was implemented
      - Check all tracked files with mcp__weaver__list_project_files

   b. **Generate Shipping Report:**
      Create a comprehensive `decision` entry via mcp__weaver__update_context_board with:

      ### Project Summary
      - What was built (features, endpoints, components)
      - Tech stack used
      - Files created/modified (count and summary)

      ### How to Run
      - Dependencies to install
      - Environment variables needed
      - Start command(s)

      ### How to Deploy
      - Build command(s)
      - Deployment target and instructions
      - Configuration needed for production

      ### Testing
      - How to run tests
      - Test coverage summary (from QA results)

      ### Known Limitations
      - Any known issues or todos
      - Future improvement suggestions

   c. **Create Dashboard Widgets:**
      - A `kpi` widget with shipping metrics (files, LOC, test count, review status)
      - A `table` widget listing all created files with their purposes
      - A `workflow` widget showing project activity summary

   d. **Create Documentation:**
      - Use mcp__weaver__add_doc with category="changelog" to record what was shipped
      - Use mcp__weaver__add_doc with category="setup" for deployment/setup guide

4. Use mcp__weaver__complete_agent_task with:
   - agent: "developer"
   - summary: "Final shipping summary created"

5. Show the user:
   - A clean, formatted shipping report
   - Deploy commands they can run right now
   - Any remaining action items
