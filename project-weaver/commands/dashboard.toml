prompt = """
The user wants to launch the Project Weaver observability dashboard.

Tell them to run these commands:

```bash
cd ~/.gemini/extensions/project-weaver/dashboard
npm install  # first time only
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in their browser.

The dashboard shows:
- Real-time agent activity feed from .weaver/logs/
- Shared context board viewer from .weaver/context.json
- Pipeline progress with stage tracking
- Mermaid architecture diagrams
- Agent communication and debates

If the dashboard directory doesn't exist yet, let them know it needs to be set up first.
