prompt = """
The user wants to build a software project using the Project Weaver AI Software Agency.

First, check if a .weaver/ project already exists using mcp__weaver__get_project_status.
If not, ask the user for a project name and description, then use mcp__weaver__init_project.

Next, gather requirements:
1. Use mcp__weaver__gather_requirements to get structured questions
2. Ask the user each unanswered question one at a time
3. Store answers using mcp__weaver__update_project_context
4. When all questions are answered (or user says "that's enough"), proceed

Then use mcp__weaver__run_pipeline to get the execution plan and execute each stage sequentially:
1. Product Manager: Create spec and user stories (use gather_requirements if needed)
2. Architect: Design architecture with Mermaid diagrams
3. Developer: Write all code files using mcp__weaver__save_file for each file
4. QA: Write test files using mcp__weaver__save_file, verify acceptance criteria
5. Code Reviewer: Review code and approve (or use mcp__weaver__request_revision)
6. Developer: Ship - finalize the project

For each stage:
- Follow the DRAFT -> SELF-REVIEW -> REFINE -> RECORD pattern
- Actually do the work - write real code, real tests, real architecture docs
- Create structured widgets for the dashboard
- Record everything on the context board and log events
