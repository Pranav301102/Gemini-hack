prompt = """
The user wants to build a software project using the Project Weaver AI Software Agency.

First, check if a .weaver/ project already exists using mcp__weaver__get_project_status.
If not, ask the user for a project name and description, then use mcp__weaver__init_project.

Next, gather requirements:
1. Use mcp__weaver__gather_requirements to get structured questions
2. Ask the user each unanswered question one at a time
3. Store answers using mcp__weaver__update_project_context
4. When all questions are answered (or user says "that's enough"), proceed

Then use mcp__weaver__run_pipeline to get the execution plan and execute each stage sequentially:
1. Architect: Scan codebase (if existing), design architecture + Coding Style Guide
2. Product Manager: Create spec and user stories ALIGNED with architecture
3. ⚠️ APPROVAL: Pause and tell the user to review on the dashboard. Wait for approval.
4. Developer: Write all code files following the style guide using mcp__weaver__save_file
5. QA: Write test files using mcp__weaver__save_file, verify acceptance criteria
6. Code Reviewer: Review code including style guide compliance, approve or use mcp__weaver__request_revision
7. Developer: Ship - finalize the project

For each stage:
- Follow the DRAFT -> SELF-REVIEW -> REFINE -> RECORD pattern
- Actually do the work - write real code, real tests, real architecture docs
- Create structured widgets for the dashboard
- Record everything on the context board and log events
